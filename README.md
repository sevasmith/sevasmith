Hi, I'm Seva ðŸ‘‹

With a love for suprematism, avant-garde art, and mathematical problem-solving, I found the perfect blend of logic and creativity in frontend development. After completing a React course, I became captivated by building clean, aesthetically refined, and user-friendly interfaces.

I'm actively seeking a frontend developer role, ideally in a startup environment where I can contribute meaningfully and grow alongside a tight-knit team. If you're hiring, I'd love to connect!

ðŸ’» Tech Stack: HTML, CSS, JavaScript, React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, TypeScript, Git, GitHub

ðŸš€ Projects: Currently building my portfolio to showcase my work
